// For this assignment I added in the tile layer first using the info from Leaflet Quick Start Guide
//I then set my zoom features to my liking based on the map.  I set them far out because I knew that the earthquake points were going to be diverse amongst different spots on earth 
//I was able to get the legend to appear on my map, but I could not figure out how to add the color next to it indicating the size of the earthquake
// I correctly plotted all the earthquakes, color coding by depth level .  I also added in the feature that allows you to click on a point and get magnitude and location
